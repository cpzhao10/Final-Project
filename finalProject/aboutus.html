      <p>Iâ€™m currently a sixteen-year-old rising junior at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School.
       I joined the Girls Who Code summer immersion program because I love to learn new things
       and I believe coding and problem-solving is something everyone should learn. I also
       love mysteries, board games, and traveling among other things.</p>

<h2>Jessica Brito</h2>
   <p>I am currently 16 and I go to Maine West High School. I joined Girls Who Code so I could expand
 my knowledge on computer science. I initially started getting interested in coding  when I would
 make One Direction accounts and wanted them to look cooler. I love going to concerts and camping in my spare time.</p>

         because I've always been interested in learning another way to communicate with the
