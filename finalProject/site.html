			<h2>Water.</h2>
			<p>
			You need it. I need it. Animals need it. And plants need it, too. Water is the very thing that is essential for life.
			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>
			But all over the world, the water in lakes, rivers, oceans, and other places are being affected by our actions.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our drinkable water is running out. Although the Earth is 70% water, only 2.5% of that is freshwater. Of that 2.5%, only 1% of it is easily accessible. That 1%- we                pollute it, we contaminate it, we waste it.
            </p>
            <p>
            The water is being polluted by trash and absorbing so many carbon emissions that the oceans are becoming acidic. This along with the rising ocean temperatures melt the               sea ice, which cause sea levels to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ocean acidification also affects wildlife both in the water and on land.
            They are being entangled in the trash, eating the garbage, mutating from the chemicals, and dying from all the effects of our pollution.
            The increase in acidity has harmful consequences, such as decreasing immune responses in some organisms. It also contributes to coral bleaching.
            </p>
            <p>
            Polluting the water increases likelihood of the water containing diseases.
            Every minute a child dies of a water-related disease and they are the number 1 cause of death of children below 5 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
            Oceans and coasts provide millions of people with jobs and billions of dollars for the economy every year. The jobs are threatened by pollution.
            In the US alone, 3 million people have ocean and coast related jobs in coastal communities.
            </p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>
            The causes of water pollution and the water ecosystems being harmed range from small actions such as throwing a plastic bottle into the ocean to large actions such as oil spills.
            </p>
            <p>
            A lot of different things are being thrown into rivers, lakes, and oceans that don’t belong there.This includes chemicals, oil, wastewater, garbage, and so many more unimaginable things.
            </p>
            <p>
          The increasingly risky development of industry is contaminating our water.
          Industries dump toxic waste into oceans, lakes, and rivers. Chemicals released by mining mixes with water to form harmful substance In Colorado, 23,000 abandoned mines have polluted 2,300 km of streams

            <p>
            Water provides so many things to us, to wildlife, to the earth. We need to treat rivers, lakes, and oceans with respect and be mindful of our actions. By being aware of problems and working together we can help and we can change.
