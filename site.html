  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <h3>Water pollution is when substances build up in the water to a point where it causes problems for people and animals.  There are two main types of water pollution: nonpoint-source pollution and point-source pollution. If pollution comes from one source, then it is point-source pollution. If it comes from multiple sources, then it is nonpoint-source pollution.</h3>
  <h3>Sometimes it’s obvious when water has been polluted, like an oil spill. But most of the time, it’s not. There are two main ways you can measure the quality of water. One way is to test the chemical indicators, or the concentration of different chemicals in the water. The other way is to test the biological indicators, or see what kind of life the water can support. If the river can’t support any life, then the quality of the river must be poor.</h3>
</div>
<div id="section21" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>The problem</h1>
  <h3>Atmospheric deposition is one of the many causes of water pollution. It is when chemicals released into the air enter the atmosphere and fall back to the earth as rain. Water pollution has so many causes and it’s why it is such a difficult problem to solve.</h3>
  <h3>Sewage is another cause.  [stats]</h3>
  <h3>When so much sewage is released into the environment, the nutrients from it can cause the growth of harmful algal blooms. These blooms remove the oxygen from the water and kill the life present in the water.</h3>
  <h3>However, pollution is not strictly limited to chemicals. It can be biological as well. The introduction of invasive species into water ecosystems can drastically change the environment. Because they have no natural predators outside their normal habitat, they can run rampant and crowd out native life.</h3>
</div>
<div id="section22" class="container-fluid">
  <h3>Plastics materials take about 400 years to degrade so with the mass production of these items are astounding. In a year 300 million tons of plastic is produced every year and only about 10% is recycled. Nonetheless plastic production is a very impactful when it comes to our Earth. Countries like Australia used to produce 7 billion bags until their ban/tax on plastic bags. Government agencies still have issues with introducing bans and taxes in their areas. As they work on that you should use plastic bags and tote bags.</h3>

  <h1>How can you stop this?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Reuse, reduce, and recyle. By doing this, it means that less trash enters the water and less wildlife will be endangered.</li>
    <li>Use reusable plastic products! Again, it means that less trash enters our environment! Plus, you are being less wasteful and you can reduce your carbon footprint!</li>
    <li>Recyle any recyclable products! You'll keep the environment less cluttered!</li>
    <li>Clean up garbage in your neighborhood! It could potentially end up in a water source!</li>
    <li>Properly dispose of hazardous material! The waste could leak through the soil and enter the groundwater.
    <li>Use less water!</li>
    <li>Take showers, not baths! You'll be wasting less water.</li>
    <li>Turn off the water when brushing your teeth</li>
    <li>Fix leaks</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="section32" class="container-fluid">
  <ul>
    <li>Educate yourself. This website is a great first step on educating yourself on water pollution.</li>
    <li>Tells others about the cause</li>
    <li>Donate to reputable charities that help with water conservation efforts</li>
    <li>Find activities that will help with the cause</li>
    <li>Demand clean water</li>
    <li>Be mindful of what you eat</li>
    <li>Eat sustainable seafood (“line caught”, “diver caught”, “sustainably caught”, “sustainably harvested”)</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Jessica here! I am currently 16 and I’m funny. I guess. I joined Girls Who Code so I could expand my knowledge on computer science. I initially started getting interested when I would make One Direction accounts and wanted them to look cooler. With everything I have learned so far I aspire to work in PR and tie it with mechanical engineering. I’ll probably make my own company.
